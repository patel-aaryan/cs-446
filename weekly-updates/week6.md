# Project Memento Week 6 Update

Feb 9 - Feb 13

- Met and demoed all the completed FE work from last week of just the scaffolding, split up remaining frontend work and continued discussion of backend auth/db and BE work split [meeting minutes](./meeting-minutes/week6.md)
- For frontend split we have the following remaining tasks:
  - Feed/close up of selected image view: Helena
  - "Add" functionality on homepage: Amirdha
  - Profile view: Alex
- For backend split we have the following:
  - Continue finalizing auth/database setup: Aaryan
  - Work on basic user flow endpoints (get all albums for a user, parse photo metadata to photo fields, etc): Priyanshu
  - Start taking a look at notification/location pinging (not for demo use case): Chiara
- Debugged and looked into lat/long metadata from uploaded image. Tried a variety of methods until OpenDocument worked and we could get access to geolocation data.
- Helena took meeting minutes and week 6 update
- Next week meeting rescheduled to Sunday due to reading week and to prepare for P4 presentation
- Goal/Task: Have all FE views using mocked data done by next Wednesday. Have BE endpoints done by upcoming Sunday. Connect and make sure flow works by next week Friday and complete presentation for next week Sunday for Monday Feb 23rd presentation.
